"""
AST-based extraction module - Pure functions for AST-based graph node extraction.

This package will provide extraction functions using Tree-sitter AST parsing:
- type_definition: Classes, interfaces, types from source code
- method: Methods and functions from type definitions
- external_dependency: Import statements and dependencies

AST extraction is faster and more deterministic than LLM-based extraction.
Implementation pending in Phase 2.
